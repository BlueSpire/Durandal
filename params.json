{"tagline":"A cross-device, cross-platform client framework written in JavaScript.","body":"# Durandal\r\n\r\nA cross-device, cross-platform application framework written in JavaScript, Durandal is a very small amount of code built on top of three existing and established Javascript libraries: jQuery, Knockout and RequireJS. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Fully modularize your html and js. ie. Shell.js automatically locates Shell.html, binds and gets composed into the dom. Naturally you can change the conventions…\r\n* Leverage promises everywhere as the API uses no callbacks, but has CommonJS promises plumbed throughout\r\n* Experience the first html/js framework where Composition is embraced at the very core. The view/view-model composition features of Durandal are even more powerful than any \"native\" client framework.\r\n* A simple app model provides you with an app start lifecycle, modal dialogs, message boxes and an event aggregator.\r\n* Build reusable, databindable, skinnable and templatable widgets.\r\n* Leverage optional components for screen and sub-screen activation and de-activation enabling elegant handling of complex screen states.\r\n* Optimize all your HTML and JavaScript into a single file for relelase.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nAll the documentation is located in the [wiki](https://github.com/EisenbergEffect/Durandal/wiki), so have a look there for help on how to get setup, tutorials, sample descriptions and module reference docs.","name":"Durandal","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
