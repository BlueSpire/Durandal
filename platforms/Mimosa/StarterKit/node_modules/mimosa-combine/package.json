This is an external module and does not come by default with Mimosa.\n\nFor more information regarding Mimosa, see http://mimosajs.com\n\n## Usage\n\nAdd `'combine'` to your list of modules.  That's all!  Mimosa will install the module for you when you start up.\n\n## Functionality\n\nThe `'combine'` module configuration contains an array of `folders` that configure what folders' contents to merge, in what order, and where to write the output.\n\nBy default, binary files, like images, are excluded from merging and this cannot be configured.  Other exclusions can be added via the config, as can an order to the files get added.\n\nWhen `mimosa build` is used, by default mimosa-combine cleans up the files it uses to build the combined file.\n\nWhen `mimosa clean` or `mimosa watch` with the `--clean` flag is run, the `combine` module will clean up the files it has written.\n\n# Config\n\n```coffeescript\n  combine:\n    folders: []\n    removeCombined:\n      enabled:true\n      exclude:[]\n```\n\n# Example Config\n\n```coffeescript\ncombine:\n  folders: [                           # An array of folder combination details\n    {\n      folder:\"stylesheets/vendor\"      # The folder to combine into a single file. Path can\n                                         # be relative to the watch config setting, or absolute.\n      output:\"stylesheets/vendor.css\"  # The output file for the folder combination. Path can\n                                         # be relative to the watch config setting, or absolute.\n      exclude:null                     # An array of regexs or strings that match files to\n                                         # exclude from matching. Can be a mix of regex and\n                                         # strings. Strings should be a path relative to the\n                                         # folder or absolute.\n                                         # ex: [/\\.txt$/, \"vendor/jqueryui.js\"], which would keep\n                                         # all .txt files and jqueryui.js out of your combined\n                                         # file.\n      order:null                       # An array of paths to the files to place at the start\n                                         # of the merged file.  You do not need to name every\n                                         # file, just those whose order is important. Paths\n                                         # can be relative to the 'folder' directory or absolute.\n                                         # Paths should point at the compiled file.

Path is relative to the watch config settings.  Path can also be absolute.\n* `combine.folders.output`: a string, the path to the output file result of the combine.  Path is relative to the watch config settings.  Path can also be absolute.\n* `combine.folders.exclude`: an array of strings and/or regexs, the list of files and file patterns to exclude from the combine.Paths should be relative to `folder` and should point at the compiled file. So foo.css, not foo.less. Regexes can also be used at the same time.  ex: `ex: [/\\.txt$/, \"vendor/jqueryui.js\"]`. Can be left off or made null if not needed.\n* `combine.folders.order`: an array of strings, the list of files to include in the combined file first. Does not need to be all the files, just the files for which order is important. Paths should be relative to `folder` and should point at the compiled file. So foo.css, not foo.less. Can be left off or made null if not needed.\n* `combine.removeCombined`: configuration for cleaning up during a `mimosa build`\n* `combine.removeCombined.enabled`: Defaults to `true`, whether or not to clean up the files that went into making the combine files.\n* `combine.removeCombined.exclude`: Files to exclude from removal, can be regex or string, strings are relative to the `watch.compiledDir`.\n\n\n# Deprecated\n\nThis config was deprecated with version `0.6.0` of mimosa-combine. With `0.7.0` support of the deprecated config will be removed.\n\nFor the depracated config, `combine.removeCombined.enabled` is set to `false` as that functionality was not available prior to `0.6.0`.\n\n## Deprecated Config\n\n```\ncombine:[]\n```\n\n## Example Deprecated Config\n\n```coffeescript\ncombine: [                           # An array of folder combination details\n  {\n    folder:\"stylesheets/vendor\"      # The folder to combine into a single file.
