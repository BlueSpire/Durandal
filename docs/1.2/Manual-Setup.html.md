# Manual Setup
#### 

Durandal works with any backend technology...or no backend technology.
All you need to get going are the necessary script libraries, modules and folder structure. 
If one of the other methods of getting started does not suit you, you can always just [download](/version/latest/Durandal.zip) the raw starter project files.
To run the starter kit, open `index.html` in Firefox.

> **Note: ** IE, Chrome and Safari don't appear to like serving the files directly from the file system. If you would like to use one of these browsers, simply use your preferred web server technology to serve the files.
