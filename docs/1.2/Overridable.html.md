#Overridable Designation
#### 

Some functions in the Durandal API are marked with the indicator [overridable](/documentation/Overridable) in the documentation. This indicates that the function is designed to be replaced by your own implementation in order to customize the behavior of the framework. You can safely replace it without worrying about negative side-effects.

> **Note:** Naturally, you can override any method in JavaScript.
