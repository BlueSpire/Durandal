# Optimizing with Mimosa
#### 

Mimosa natively understands applications built with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), so optimization is a synch.
The following console command will do it for you:

```javascript
mimosa build -mo
```

That said, we have provided a _build.bat_ file for convenience, which makes sure everything is cleaned up and output to a _dist_ folder.
For further options and additional information on Mimosa, [see their official documentation](http://mimosajs.com/optimization.html).
