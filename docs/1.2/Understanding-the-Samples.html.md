# Understanding the Samples
#### 

The github repo contains a number of samples located at 'App/Samples'. Each sample lives in its own folder, but is composed into the sample shell's navigation.

* **hello** - Demonstrates a basic hello world application which uses view/view-model location conventions and message box functionality.
* **masterDetail** - Demonstrates some activation features as well as containerless composition.
* **widgets** - Demonstrates basic bindable and templatable widgets.
* **viewComposition** - Demonstrates simple deconstruction of views bound against the same binding context.
* **eventAggregator** - Shows how to use loosely coupled messaging between modules.
* **modal** - Demonstrates how to show a custom modal dialog and how to leverage promises for return values.
* **knockout** - The official knockout samples, running inside of durandal, demonstrating deep linking.

> **Note:** The sample shell itself serves as an example of a simple navigation architecture.
