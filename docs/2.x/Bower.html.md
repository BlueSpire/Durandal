# Using Bower
#### 

>Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack.

This is an excellent way to acquire the Durandal library in web apps that rely on Bower for front-end package managment. To add Durandal to your project via Bower, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js
2. From the command line execute: `npm install -g bower`
3. After bower is installed, navigate to your web app and execute the following on the command line: `bower install durandal`
