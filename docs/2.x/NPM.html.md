# Using NPM
#### 

>npm is the package manager for Node.js. It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.

This is an excellent way to acquire the Durandal library in web apps that rely on NPM (Node's Package Manager) for front-end package managment. To add Durandal to your project via NPM, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js
2. From the command line execute: `npm install --save durandal`
3. Your `package.json` will now have an updated `dependencies` key
4. Package is installed into `node_modules`
