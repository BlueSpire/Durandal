  <h1>Understanding the Starter Kit</h1>
<h4> </h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The Durandal StarterKit sets up a basic navigation-style architecture for you along with a couple of basic screens. Adding your own screens is as simple as creating modules and views, putting them in the proper location and registering them with the router. Let&#39;s see how this application is put together...</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Application Organization</h3>
<p>If you expand the <em>App</em> folder, you will find the source for the entire SPA sample. Here&#39;s the high level organization you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>App<ul>
<li>durandal/</li>
<li>viewmodels/</li>
<li>views/</li>
<li>main.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Durandal applications are built as a collection of AMD modules. In fact, Durandal itself is just a set of modules. All the core modules can be found in the <em>durandal</em> folder. The <em>viewmodels</em> and <em>views</em> folders contain the application-specific code. In your own application, you can organize your app-specific code in any way that makes sense to you. For purposes of this sample, we&#39;ve located our viewmodels and views in folders thusly-named (a common convention). Finally, much like a native application, your app execution always starts with <em>main</em> which is referenced in the <em>index.html</em>.</p>
<h3>index.html</h3>
<p>The <em>index.html</em> has all the things you would expect, such as meta, css links and 3rd party script references. The interesting part is the body:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;applicationHost&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/App/durandal/amd/require.js&quot; data-main=&quot;/App/main&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>
<p>The <em>applicationHost</em> is where your app&#39;s views will live. We&#39;ll talk about how that happens a bit more in the next section. Below that is the script tag that references RequireJS. It points to our application&#39;s entry point, declared in the <em>data-main</em> attribute. At runtime, this resolves to the <em>main.js</em> file.</p>
<h3>main.js</h3>
<p>The <em>main.js</em> module is where you configure durandal and tell it to start up the app. Let&#39;s look at the main module and see what we can learn:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">define(function(require) {
    var app = require(&#39;durandal/app&#39;),
        viewLocator = require(&#39;durandal/viewLocator&#39;),
        system = require(&#39;durandal/system&#39;),
        router = require(&#39;durandal/plugins/router&#39;);

    system.debug(true);

    app.start().then(function () {
        viewLocator.useConvention();

        router.useConvention();
        router.mapNav(&#39;welcome&#39;);
        router.mapNav(&#39;flickr&#39;);

        app.adaptToDevice();
        app.setRoot(&#39;viewmodels/shell&#39;, &#39;entrance&#39;);
    });
});</pre>
<p>The most important thing to learn from this example is that all app-specific code is written as modules. There is one module per file and each module declares itself by calling <code>define</code>. It can then <em>require</em> other modules in the application by referencing their path. In this example, we can see that our <em>main</em> module is dependent on four other modules <em>app</em>, <em>viewLocator</em>, <em>system</em> and <em>router</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When calling <em>define</em> to declare a module, you pass it a function, which returns your module. This is important. The return value of your function is your module and is the same object that will be passed to any consumer that calls <em>require</em>. You can return either an object (singleton modules) or a function (for constructors) from your define call. For further information on creating modules, see the RequireJS documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next thing of note is the call to <code>system.debug(true)</code>. Durandal&#39;s <em>system</em> module has a <em>log</em> function which it uses to output important insights into the working of the framework. This log implementation is cross-browser and will only be output when debugging is turned on, as it is here. This logging information can help you track down issues with your code as well as give you a deeper understanding of how Durandal works. It is also handy for use in your own app-specific code.</p>
<p>In order to kick things off, we call <code>app.start()</code> which returns a promise. The promise resolves when the dom is ready and the framework is prepared for configuration. At that point we set up our <em>viewLocator</em> and <em>router</em>. Then, we call <code>app.adaptToDevice()</code> to make sure that our app acts like a SPA, especially on mobile divices. Finally, we call <code>app.setRoot</code>. Let&#39;s go over a few of these APIs:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>viewLocator.useConvention()</code> - Whenever durandal needs to display a module, it uses the <em>viewLocator</em> to find the appropriate view. Usually, it&#39;s a straight name mapping. So, <em>welcome</em> would map to <em>welcome.html</em>. When we call <code>useConvention()</code> we tell the framework that we have a conventionally organized project where we are putting all view models in a particular place and all views in a particular place. So, it maps accordingly. The standard convention would map <em>viewmodels/welcome</em> to <em>views/welcome.html</em>. You can change all of this, of course. Details are provided in the docs on the view locator.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>router.useConvention()</code> and <code>router.mapNav()</code> - Our calls to <em>mapNav</em> register a route pattern with the router, and specify that these routes are intended to be displayed as part of the app&#39;s navigation UI. There are many ways to map routes. Here we see the simplest, where <em>mapNav</em> is called with one parameter. This parameter is the route. Durandal&#39;s router attempts to map routes to modules. So, by default, if we don&#39;t specify a specific module (the optional second parameter to mapNav) then the router assumes the module has the same name as the route (minus any parameters). But, in our case, we are using the standard convention for organizing by viewmodels and views. So, we need to tell the router that by calling <em>useConvention</em>. In this case, if the <em>mapNav</em> call doesn&#39;t specify a module, it will assume that it&#39;s the same as the router name, but in the <em>viewmodels</em> folder. So <code>mapNav(&#39;welcome&#39;)</code> tells the routing mechanism to map the uri hash &#39;#/welcome&#39; to the <code>viewmodels/welcome</code> module.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>app.setRoot()</code> - This is what actually causes the dom to be composed with your application. It points to your main viewmodel (or view). When this is called, Durandal&#39;s composition infrastructure is invoked causing RequireJS to require your root view model, use the <em>viewLocator</em> to locate it&#39;s view, databind them together and inject them into the <em>applicationHost</em> element. Additionally, the &#39;entrance&#39; transition animation is used to animate the app in.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The code described above differs from app to app, but usually your main.js will follow the same simple steps every time:</p>
<ol>
<li>(Turn on debugging).</li>
<li>Call <code>app.start()</code>.</li>
<li>Configure your app-specific conventions.</li>
<li>Configure 3rd party libraries.</li>
<li>Set your application&#39;s root.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Shell</h3>
<p>Every application has a shell/window/layout/etc. We set that by calling <code>setRoot</code> as described above. Typically, you will have both a code and view component to your shell, as is demonstrated in our starter kit. Let&#39;s look at simplified versions of those to see how they work:</p>
<p><em>shell.js</em></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">define(function(require) {
    var router = require(&#39;durandal/plugins/router&#39;);

    return {
        router: router,
        activate: function () {
            return router.activate(&#39;welcome&#39;);
        }
    };
});</pre>
<p><em>shell.html</em></p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;navbar navbar-fixed-top&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;navbar-inner&quot;&gt;
            &lt;ul class=&quot;nav&quot; data-bind=&quot;foreach: router.visibleRoutes&quot;&gt;
                &lt;li data-bind=&quot;css: { active: isActive }&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;a data-bind=&quot;attr: { href: hash }, html: name&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;container-fluid page-host&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!--ko compose: { 
            model: router.activeItem,
            afterCompose: router.afterCompose,
            transition:&#39;entrance&#39;
        }--&gt;&lt;!--/ko--&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>When you call <code>setRoot</code>, Durandal requires both the module and the html and uses Knockout to databind them together. It then injects them into the dom&#39;s <em>applicationHost</em>. If you look at the module, you will see that we have exposed the router as a property called <em>router</em>. Then, look at the html for the &quot;nav bar&quot; and you will see that we are dynamically generating our navigation structure based on the router&#39;s <em>visibleRoutes</em> array. Below that we have a container where our pages will be switched in and out. How does that work?</p>
<p>Durandal takes Knockout&#39;s databinding implementation and layers a powerful &quot;composition&quot; system on top of it. In the case of our shell, the router is tracking the current route. It stores the route&#39;s module instance in its <em>activeItem</em> observable property. The router is then bound through Durandal&#39;s <em>compose</em> binding. Now any time the router changes it&#39;s active item, the dom will re-compose with the new view. Here&#39;s how it happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>A route is triggered and the router finds the module and sets it as its <em>activeItem</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>compose</em> binding detects that the <em>activeItem</em> has changed. It examines the value and finds the appropriate view (you guessed it...using the <em>viewLocator</em>).</li>
<li>The <em>activeItem</em> and the located view are databound together.</li>
<li>The bound view is inserted into the dom at the location of the <em>compose</em> binding.</li>
<li>If the <em>compose</em> binding specifies an animation, it is used to smoothly show the new view.</li>
</ol>
<p>The compose binding is used here to enable navigation by &quot;composing&quot; in different views. It is a very versatile and powerful feature of the framework capable of doing much, much more than this. By combining the ability to break down an app into small modules, each with their own view, along with the ability to re-compose in the UI, you can accomplish extremely complex user experiences, with relatively little effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It&#39;s important to note that the router must be activated with a default route before it can function properly. This is done in the shell&#39;s activate function. Durandal&#39;s application infrastructure checks the shell for an <em>activate</em> function and calls it if found. Note that the call to <code>router.activate()</code> returns from the shell&#39;s <em>activate</em> function. Since the router&#39;s activation is asynchronous, it returns a promise that indicates when it is ready. You should return this from the shell&#39;s activate function so that Durandal&#39;s infrastructure can understand the asynchronous nature of your application&#39;s startup and appropriately orchestrate binding and composition. You can learn more about the power of asynchronous activation and screen lifecycles in the documentation on the <em>viewModel</em> module.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Views and View Models</h3>
<p>Each page in our navigation application is comprised of a view and a view model. Once you&#39;ve set up the structure as described above, all there is to extending the application is dropping new view models in the <em>viewmodels</em> folder along with an appropriate view in the <em>views</em> folder. Then, you just register the router in <em>main.js</em>. When the corresponding router is navigated to, the router will locate your module and the composition infrastructure will see to it that it&#39;s bound and inserted into the dom.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Durandal apps are organized into AMD modules and HTML views.</li>
<li>Developers use the <em>main.js</em> to configure the framework, set up 3rd party libraries and start Durandal with their &quot;root&quot; view model (or view).</li>
<li>You can use the router plugin to create a navigation-style application by requiring it and configuring it with routes.</li>
<li>Your shell activates the router and provides any application-wide data or functionality.</li>
<li>Use &quot;composition&quot; in your shell&#39;s view to realize navigation page changes.</li>
<li>Extend the application by creating views and view models for each page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>Durandal can do much more than described here. In the wiki you will find reference documentation on all the modules as well has How To&#39;s related to various common tasks. You&#39;ll also find information on application optimization for the web as well as how to get up in running with PhoneGap and AppJS for building native applications. Dig in and enjoy!</p>
